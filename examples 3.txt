{Happy to do Jackâ€™s and something different if there are toilets and phone reception there.  
Otherwise I would do the hall â€“ heading to Kawarau Falls gives about 3â€“4 different environments along the way.  
Or Queenstown Gardens. Pine trees around the outside, rose garden and other trees in the middle â€“ toilets and kind of containable.}

{I looked at the dates and remembered why we chose that week.  
We wonâ€™t be able to reschedule sorry.  
Iâ€™m running the lead on this so I have to be there.  
1 Oct is when we switch to the summer schedule at work and Iâ€™ve got a bunch of critical stuff to get done.  
Term 2 holidays are too close and slammed with Cardrona.  
Canâ€™t do summer (too busy at work), and we canâ€™t go during the term.  
So 21â€“26 is locked in. Sorry if this doesnâ€™t work for you.  
Iâ€™ll get more info out later this week â€“ ice cream trailer and fundraising plans too.  
Also need to finalise Routeburn end of next week.}

{All good.  
Letâ€™s do the following week.  
Maybe the Tuesday or near the Scout Hall so I can be there for most of it.  
Would be fun to walk through the trailer together.}

{Itâ€™s the main material that wasnâ€™t.  
All good â€“ just purchased, itâ€™ll show up in a few days.  
Iâ€™ve ordered enough for about 40 scarves â€“ no expectation for you to do all that.  
Just wanted to get ahead.  
If we can do 10 before the end of term that would be amazing â€“ weâ€™re a bit behind handing them out to the new Cubs and Scouts.}

{Thanks. Iâ€™ll bring some over.  
Anything else you need?  
Should be there by 4:30ish.  
Girls might come a little later.}

{Sorry honey.  
Kids should be tired anyway.  
Iâ€™ll be home by 6:15 prob and can do dinner/bedtime.}

{Hi Graham.  
Not surprised about the interest, itâ€™s a great role for a great company.  
Iâ€™m at Totaranui Beach this week. Reception goes from 1 bar to 0 (which is kind of the point â€“ stepping away and keeping the no-work promise to the kids).  
Tried a call the other day but dropped out after a minute.

We leave Friday and head to Hanmer, so Iâ€™ll have reception Mon/Tue â€“ though mostly at the pools. Could step away first thing or later arvo.  
Wedâ€“Fri is wide open â€“ can make time easily.

Let me know what works.  
Thanks,  
Iain}

{Thank you.  
Could you do a formal quote please and Iâ€™ll push it to them asap and see what they say.  
Weâ€™ve got a pretty good plan.  
Weâ€™re keen, but just have to evaluate where we spend money at the moment.  
Thanks,  
Iain}

{Thanks for your patience.  
Alex is working on the fabric side. We still havenâ€™t completely wrapped our heads around how it works, which is why I was hoping to talk to someone today.  
From our call the other week, sounds like we pick a seat and it gets upholstered locally. Thatâ€™s the bit we donâ€™t quite get, donâ€™t the international ones have local upholstery places? Or is it just standard to ship frames and upholster at this end?

Assuming we upholster locally and Alex chooses fabric, I assume upholstery cost is similar?  
Can you give us a quote for the following, excluding upholstery:

1. McConnell Executive â€“ as per last build
2. Style Ride Silhouette â€“ https://styleride.com.au/products/silhouette/
3. Vogel (from the B8s?) â€“ Magnio Luxury â€“ https://www.vogelsitze.com/en/busseats-intercity-transport/

Also â€” please send through options for USBs, footrests, and magazine pockets.

Thanks,  
Iain}

{just tried calling them but no answer. 
if they call you back. 
we only have 4 on tomorrow and 2 on Wed. 
So we could use something smaller}

{Hey Team,Â 

Didn't have much luck with the previous ads, switching tactics and doing seasonal instead.Â 

We also need this as we've evolved the plan for rookie drivers to do Summer seasonal then winter seasonal (learning different skills in each season).Â  if they're doing winter seasonal then it is Ski only and a different PD to the perm drivers. Mikayla specifically we want to put into this.Â 

If that training and working all goes well and they build up the skills then we would look to do permanent after that.

Thanks

Iain}

{Hey Daniel,Â   
Don't think I'm going to get my wish of loading up the team with people who can roll over into the summer. So open to some people being on winter only contracts.Â   
big concern with you though is still the training period.Â 

We have 2 weeks of ski training from 26 May to 6 June.Â 

You have some background in ski driving which helps, but it's far from ideal.Â 

Best bet might be for you and I to go for a drive together over the next couple of weeks and see how what you're like behind the wheel. We can then chat in more detail about the possibilities.Â 

Thanks

Iain}

{Hey Ross.
Just be careful when you park up the top.
You put 220 into an aj hacket bus park by accident.
Peanut didn't notice, so put her car in that spot, so was parked there for the last 2 days.}

{Ah crap, yeah, I need to get on that.

We originally did it to sponsor Blake, who Iâ€™ve been umming and ahhing about, but Iâ€™m going to move forward with it, just a bit differently.

Iâ€™ll try and review everything today to get the ball rolling.

sorry for the delay.}

{Sounds good. 
Should we do 11th Ave again at 9?}

{Sounds good, thanks Dan. I can do tomorrow morning.

What side of town are you on? I'm in Shotover Country but work in town, so happy to meet anywhere between Shotover Country, Arthurs Point, and town.

Also, what's your phone number? Might be easier to finalise things that way, or you can just text me back on 027 563 7995.}

{Hi Hannah,

Hope you had a nice long weekend and don't see this until Tuesday. 

Just a quick request for today (Sunday). One of the drivers called in sick this morning and we couldn't get anyone else in. A bunch were out late last night and a few others are away.

I ended up driving the day into Milford Sound to ensure we didn't have to cancel anything. I've got a lot on with the build up to ski season, so I won't be able to reclaim a day and a half anytime soon.

Could I take it as an additional day of pay instead? It's budgeted for someone to drive it anyway, and I could use the cash more than another day of annual leave. I've still got over four weeks to use up.

All good if not, just thought I'd ask.

Thanks,
Iain }

{Thanks. Yeah, I hit up Janelle about it as well, and we discovered that if you've done it, it disappears from your Mahitahi homepage, which is pretty cool. Also makes for an interesting way to walk around the office and see who's done the survey or not ðŸ˜‚}

{Hey Team.
I'd also like to welcome Claire, who will be helping out part time with cubs as well as her husband Troy sometimes. 
Claire and Troy both travel a bit for work, so can't commit to every week but are super keen to be involved.
There son Zac, will also be joining us in cubs for a few terms before movingÂ upÂ toÂ scouts}

{Also sounds like the girls have been conspiring to have a sleep over then run a bake sale at the bus stop to raise money for some charities.
Ever said they were going to sleep over at yours? Maybe tomorrow night? 
Have you heard anything about this yet?

Sat night and the sale on sunday would work better on our end, got a couple plans tomorrow and sat.
Then Charlotte wants a friend to sleep over on sat night, so it would be good to have Ever have something on.

If neither night works for you, no drama. I only heard about theÂ ideaÂ 30minÂ ago.}
