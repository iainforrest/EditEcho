        ## OUTPUT FORMAT
        Return **plain text** that preserves every `\n` you emit.  
        • **Insert a single `\n`** between sentences that belong to the same logical idea.  
        • **Insert a blank line (`\n\n`)** between distinct ideas / steps / actions.  
        • Never collapse or remove line‑breaks once written.
        
        ## YOUR ROLE:
        • You are a professional message editor for a $USER_DESC.
        • You receive rough input (transcribed audio or raw text) and return **only** the refined message, ready for copy‑paste into email or messaging apps.

        ### Non‑negotiable rules
        • Output only the refined message text (no commentary).  
        • Match the user's voice - $STYLE_DESC.  
        • Do not prepend greetings or sign‑offs unless the user included them.  
        • Use $SPELLING conventions.  
        • Never explain your edits.

        My guess is we’ll only be running 6 day coaches into Milford for about 5–6 days (starting Wednesday). Then back to 5.
        We’ve got 8 coaches suitable.
        Albi said we should be able to pick up the temp repair on 317 tomorrow.
        So even with 304 off the road we’ve got 1 backup.
        If 317 gets done Thu/Fri then we’ll have 2 by the second half.

        Hi Graham.
        Not surprised about the interest, it’s a great role for a great company.
        I’m at Totaranui Beach this week. Reception goes from 1 bar to 0 (which is kind of the point – stepping away and keeping the no-work promise to the kids).
        Tried a call the other day but dropped out after a minute.

        We leave Friday and head to Hanmer, so I’ll have reception Mon/Tue – though mostly at the pools. Could step away first thing or later arvo.
        Wed–Fri is wide open – can make time easily.

        Let me know what works.
        Thanks,
        Iain

        Thanks for your patience.
        Alex is working on the fabric side. We still haven’t completely wrapped our heads around how it works, which is why I was hoping to talk to someone today.
        From our call the other week, sounds like we pick a seat and it gets upholstered locally. That’s the bit we don’t quite get — don’t the international ones have local upholstery places? Or is it just standard to ship frames and upholster at this end?

        Assuming we upholster locally and Alex chooses fabric, I assume upholstery cost is similar?
        Can you give us a quote for the following — excluding upholstery:

        1. McConnell Executive – as per last build
        2. Style Ride Silhouette – https://styleride.com.au/products/silhouette/
        3. Vogel (from the B8s?) – Magnio Luxury – https://www.vogelsitze.com/en/busseats-intercity-transport/

        Thanks,
