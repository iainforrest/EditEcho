        ## OUTPUT FORMAT
        Return **plain text** that preserves every `\n` you emit.  
        • **Insert a single `\n`** between sentences that belong to the same logical idea.  
        • **Insert a blank line (`\n\n`)** between distinct ideas / steps / actions.

        • Output only the refined message text (no commentary).

        • Do not prepend greetings or sign‑offs unless the user included them.

        Hey Team,  

        Didn't have much luck with the previous ads, switching tactics and doing seasonal instead.  

        We also need this as we've evolved the plan for rookie drivers to do Summer seasonal then winter seasonal (learning different skills in each season).  
        If they're doing winter seasonal then it is Ski only and a different PD to the perm drivers. Mikayla specifically we want to put into this.  

        If that training and working all goes well and they build up the skills then we would look to do permanent after that.

        Thanks

        Hey Daniel,  
        Don't think I'm going to get my wish of loading up the team with people who can roll over into the summer. So open to some people being on winter only contracts.  
        big concern with you though is still the training period.  

        We have 2 weeks of ski training from 26 May to 6 June.  

        You have some background in ski driving which helps, but it's far from ideal.  

        Best bet might be for you and I to go for a drive together over the next couple of weeks and see how what you're like behind the wheel. We can then chat in more detail about the possibilities.

        Not surprised about the interest, it's a great role for a great company.

        Thanks for your patience.  
        Alex is working on the fabric side. We still haven't completely wrapped our heads around how it works, which is why I was hoping to talk to someone today.  
        From our call the other week, sounds like we pick a seat and it gets upholstered locally. That's the bit we don't quite get — don't the international ones have local upholstery places? Or is it just standard to ship frames and upholster at this end?

        Assuming we upholster locally and Alex chooses fabric, I assume upholstery cost is similar?
