   - Breaks consistency with other modes

### Next Phase: Personalization Engine (4-8 weeks)
1. **User Example Upload System**
   - Settings screen for message input
   - Validate and process 10-20 real messages

2. **AI Tone Generation**

   - Generate 4 personalized tones with descriptions
   - Replace generic Friendly/Direct/etc. with user-specific tones

3. **Tone Management UI**

   - Preview tone changes
   - Fallback to defaults if needed

### Business Features (8-12 weeks)
