Example 1

"Happy to do Jack’s and something different if there are toilets and phone reception there.  
Otherwise I would do the hall – heading to Kawarau Falls gives about 3–4 different environments along the way.  
Or Queenstown Gardens. Pine trees around the outside, rose garden and other trees in the middle – toilets and kind of containable."

Example 2

"I looked at the dates and remembered why we chose that week.  
We won’t be able to reschedule sorry.  
I’m running the lead on this so I have to be there.  
1 Oct is when we switch to the summer schedule at work and I’ve got a bunch of critical stuff to get done.  
Term 2 holidays are too close and slammed with Cardrona.  
Can’t do summer (too busy at work), and we can’t go during the term.  
So 21–26 is locked in. Sorry if this doesn’t work for you.  
I’ll get more info out later this week – ice cream trailer and fundraising plans too.  
Also need to finalise Routeburn end of next week."

Example 3

"All good.  
Let’s do the following week.  
Maybe the Tuesday or near the Scout Hall so I can be there for most of it.  
Would be fun to walk through the trailer together."

Example 4

"It’s the main material that wasn’t.  
All good – just purchased, it’ll show up in a few days.  
I’ve ordered enough for about 40 scarves – no expectation for you to do all that.  
Just wanted to get ahead.  
If we can do 10 before the end of term that would be amazing – we’re a bit behind handing them out to the new Cubs and Scouts."

Example 5

"Thanks. I’ll bring some over.  
Anything else you need?  
Should be there by 4:30ish.  
Girls might come a little later."

Example 6

"Sorry honey.  
Kids should be tired anyway.  
I’ll be home by 6:15 prob and can do dinner/bedtime."

Example  7

"yes.  
talked to franki about this last week.  
Can we please make all driving jobs visa support standard"

Example  8

"Doesn’t alter much.  
Good as a rescue down there.  
My guess is we’ll only be running 6 day coaches into Milford for about 5–6 days (starting Wednesday). Then back to 5.  
We’ve got 8 coaches suitable.  
Albi said we should be able to pick up the temp repair on 317 tomorrow.  
So even with 304 off the road we’ve got 1 backup.  
If 317 gets done Thu/Fri then we’ll have 2 by the second half."

Example 9

"Hi Graham.  
Not surprised about the interest, it’s a great role for a great company.  
I’m at Totaranui Beach this week. Reception goes from 1 bar to 0 (which is kind of the point – stepping away and keeping the no-work promise to the kids).  
Tried a call the other day but dropped out after a minute.

We leave Friday and head to Hanmer, so I’ll have reception Mon/Tue – though mostly at the pools. Could step away first thing or later arvo.  
Wed–Fri is wide open – can make time easily.

Let me know what works.  
Thanks,  
Iain"

Example10

"Thanks Judi,  
Best of luck with the current applicants and have a great summer.  
Iain"

Example 11

"Thank you.  
Could you do a formal quote please and I’ll push it to them asap and see what they say.  
We’ve got a pretty good plan.  
We’re keen, but just have to evaluate where we spend money at the moment.  
Thanks,  
Iain"

Example 12

"Thanks for your patience.  
Alex is working on the fabric side. We still haven’t completely wrapped our heads around how it works, which is why I was hoping to talk to someone today.  
From our call the other week, sounds like we pick a seat and it gets upholstered locally. That’s the bit we don’t quite get, don’t the international ones have local upholstery places? Or is it just standard to ship frames and upholster at this end?

Assuming we upholster locally and Alex chooses fabric, I assume upholstery cost is similar?  
Can you give us a quote for the following, excluding upholstery:

1. McConnell Executive – as per last build
2. Style Ride Silhouette – https://styleride.com.au/products/silhouette/
3. Vogel (from the B8s?) – Magnio Luxury – https://www.vogelsitze.com/en/busseats-intercity-transport/

Also — please send through options for USBs, footrests, and magazine pockets.

Thanks,  
Iain"

Example 13

"just tried calling them but no answer. 
if they call you back. 
we only have 4 on tomorrow and 2 on Wed. 
So we could use something smaller"

Example 14

"Hey Team, 

Didn't have much luck with the previous ads, switching tactics and doing seasonal instead. 

We also need this as we've evolved the plan for rookie drivers to do Summer seasonal then winter seasonal (learning different skills in each season).  if they're doing winter seasonal then it is Ski only and a different PD to the perm drivers. Mikayla specifically we want to put into this. 

If that training and working all goes well and they build up the skills then we would look to do permanent after that.

Thanks

Iain"

Example 15

"Hey Daniel,   
Don't think I'm going to get my wish of loading up the team with people who can roll over into the summer. So open to some people being on winter only contracts.   
big concern with you though is still the training period. 

We have 2 weeks of ski training from 26 May to 6 June. 

You have some background in ski driving which helps, but it's far from ideal. 

Best bet might be for you and I to go for a drive together over the next couple of weeks and see how what you're like behind the wheel. We can then chat in more detail about the possibilities. 

Thanks

Iain"

Example 16

"Hey Ross.
Just be careful when you park up the top.
You put 220 into an aj hacket bus park by accident.
Peanut didn't notice, so put her car in that spot, so was parked there for the last 2 days."

Example 17

"Ah crap, yeah, I need to get on that.

We originally did it to sponsor Blake, who I’ve been umming and ahhing about, but I’m going to move forward with it, just a bit differently.

I’ll try and review everything today to get the ball rolling.

sorry for the delay."

Example 18

"Sounds good. 
Should we do 11th Ave again at 9?"
