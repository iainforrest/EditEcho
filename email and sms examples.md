### Scout Leaders (Planning)

Happy to do Jack’s and something different if there are toilets and phone reception there.  
Otherwise I would do the hall – heading to Kawarau Falls gives about 3–4 different environments along the way.  
Or Queenstown Gardens. Pine trees around the outside, rose garden and other trees in the middle – toilets and kind of containable.

### Parents – Melbourne Trip

I looked at the dates and remembered why we chose that week.  
We won’t be able to reschedule sorry.  
I’m running the lead on this so I have to be there.  
1 Oct is when we switch to the summer schedule at work and I’ve got a bunch of critical stuff to get done.  
Term 2 holidays are too close and slammed with Cardrona.  
Can’t do summer (too busy at work), and we can’t go during the term.  
So 21–26 is locked in. Sorry if this doesn’t work for you.  
I’ll get more info out later this week – ice cream trailer and fundraising plans too.  
Also need to finalise Routeburn end of next week.

### Planning Meeting

All good.  
Let’s do the following week.  
Maybe the Tuesday or near the Scout Hall so I can be there for most of it.  
Would be fun to walk through the trailer together.

### One-to-One – Workish

It’s the main material that wasn’t.  
All good – just purchased, it’ll show up in a few days.  
I’ve ordered enough for about 40 scarves – no expectation for you to do all that.  
Just wanted to get ahead.  
If we can do 10 before the end of term that would be amazing – we’re a bit behind handing them out to the new Cubs and Scouts.

### Family Chat

Thanks. I’ll bring some over.  
Anything else you need?  
Should be there by 4:30ish.  
Girls might come a little later.

### Internal Work – Visa Support

Can we please make all driving jobs visa support standard

### Internal Work – Coach Availability

Doesn’t alter much.  
Good as a rescue down there.  
My guess is we’ll only be running 6 day coaches into Milford for about 5–6 days (starting Wednesday). Then back to 5.  
We’ve got 8 coaches suitable.  
Albi said we should be able to pick up the temp repair on 317 tomorrow.  
So even with 304 off the road we’ve got 1 backup.  
If 317 gets done Thu/Fri then we’ll have 2 by the second half.

### Semi-Formal – Career Conversation

Hi Graham.  
Not surprised about the interest, it’s a great role for a great company.  
I’m at Totaranui Beach this week. Reception goes from 1 bar to 0 (which is kind of the point – stepping away and keeping the no-work promise to the kids).  
Tried a call the other day but dropped out after a minute.

We leave Friday and head to Hanmer, so I’ll have reception Mon/Tue – though mostly at the pools. Could step away first thing or later arvo.  
Wed–Fri is wide open – can make time easily.

Let me know what works.  
Thanks,  
Iain

### Health Quote Request

Thank you.  
Could you do a formal quote please and I’ll push it to them asap and see what they say.  
We’ve got a pretty good plan.  
We’re keen, but just have to evaluate where we spend money at the moment.  
Thanks,  
Iain

### External Work – Bus Seats Quote

Thanks for your patience.  
Alex is working on the fabric side. We still haven’t completely wrapped our heads around how it works, which is why I was hoping to talk to someone today.  
From our call the other week, sounds like we pick a seat and it gets upholstered locally. That’s the bit we don’t quite get — don’t the international ones have local upholstery places? Or is it just standard to ship frames and upholster at this end?

Assuming we upholster locally and Alex chooses fabric, I assume upholstery cost is similar?  
Can you give us a quote for the following — excluding upholstery:

1. McConnell Executive – as per last build  
2. Style Ride Silhouette – https://styleride.com.au/products/silhouette/  
3. Vogel (from the B8s?) – Magnio Luxury – https://www.vogelsitze.com/en/busseats-intercity-transport/

Also — please send through options for USBs, footrests, and magazine pockets.

Thanks,  
Iain
